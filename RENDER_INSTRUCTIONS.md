# 🚀 Quick Deploy to Render

I have prepared the project for a seamless deployment to Render using a **Blueprint (render.yaml)**. This will automatically set up both the Backend and Frontend for you.

### 📋 Prerequisites

1.  **GitHub Repo**: Your code must be pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Supabase Database**: Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` from Supabase is ready.
3.  **Gemini API Key**: Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Push to GitHub
Make sure all recent changes (including the new `render.yaml`) are pushed to your repo:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Deploy on Render
1.  Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).
2.  Click **"New +"** and select **"Blueprint"**.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository.
4.  Render will detect the `render.yaml` and show:
    *   **resume-analyzer-backend** (Web Service)
    *   **resume-analyzer-frontend** (Static Site)
5.  **Configure Environment Variables** when prompted:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Paste your Supabase URL.
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Paste your Google Gemini Key.
    *   `SECRET_KEY`: (Auto-generated by Blueprint).
6.  Click **"Apply"**.

#### 3. Final Step: Sync Frontend with Backend
Once the deployment starts:
1.  Copy the **Public URL** of your `resume-analyzer-backend` (e.g., `https://resume-analyzer-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`).
2.  Go to the **Environment** settings of your `resume-analyzer-frontend` service in Render.
3.  Update the `VITE_API_URL` variable with your backend URL.
4.  Trigger a **Manual Deploy** of the frontend to apply the new URL.

### 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification
*   **Backend Health**: Visit `https://your-backend.onrender.com/healthz` (Should say `{"status": "healthy"}`).
*   **API Docs**: Visit `https://your-backend.onrender.com/docs`.
*   **Frontend**: Visit your frontend URL and try signing up.

### ⚠️ Important Notes for Render Free Tier
*   **Cold Starts**: The backend will "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request might take 30 seconds to wake up.
*   **Memory Limit**: Render Free Tier has 512MB RAM. I have optimized the code to use CPU-only modes for AI models to stay within this limit.
*   **Build Time**: The first build might take 5-7 minutes as it installs heavy AI dependencies (Torch, Transformers).
